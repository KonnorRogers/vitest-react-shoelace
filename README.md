# React + Vitest + Shoelace

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules and Shoelace + Vitest.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KonnorRogers/vitest-react-shoelace
cd vitest-react-shoelace
npm install
npm run test
```

## Extra notes

If you disable Vitest browser testing and enable `JSDOM` browser testing, you can watch the test suite magically fail.
